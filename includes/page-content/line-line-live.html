         All you need to do is refresh the page and a new "scenario" will appear. Hose lines are from 1.75" - 3" You will need to solve for the first scenario, and when you solve for the first section the next part of the scenario will populate.

       <p>This is a test to see how to dynamically put the values into words in HTML</p>
       <p><strong>You arrive on the scene to find a <span class="scene-elevation"></span>. The Officer tells the firefighter
       to grab a <span class="scene-5"></span> foot <span class="scene-hose"></span> line from the truck<span class="scene-nozzle"></span>
       The firefighter radios in that they are going to be running the line at <span class="scene-rand-gpm"></span> GPM. What psi are you going to run the line at for this scenario?</strong></p>
       <p>You will notice that every time you refresh the page that the values change in the middle
        of the sentences. This is how the scenario will be dynamically populated</p>
