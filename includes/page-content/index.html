      <p>There are minimal styles for this directory by itself. I wanted to focus on functionality. The styles that are in here are more for improving readability than anything.</p><br>
      <a href="line-line.html">This will take you to the First scene type</a><br>
      <a href="fdc-line.html">This will take you to the Second scene type</a><br>
      <a href="monitor-line.html">This will take you to the Third scene type</a><br>
      <a href="supply-line-line.html">This will take you to the Fourth scene type</a><br><br><br><br>
      <a href="" class="random-link">This will randomize the scenes</a><p> This would be the only visible link and pull in the random href.<br><br><br></p>
      <p>The entire functionality of this will revolve around the ability to geenerate random scenarios with the link above. It would say somehting to the effect of "start your scenario" as a button.</p>
      <p>To see this in action on my site go to <a href="https://pump.gsamsmith.com/">pump.gsamsmith.com</a>.
