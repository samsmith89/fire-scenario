      <h3>This will solve the friction loss when you are hooking up to a standpipe connection on a structure. Once you have solved for the first section you will solve for an additional line coming off the truck.</h3>
       <p>
         All you need to do is refresh the page and a new "scenario" will appear. Supplu lines to the FDC are 2.5" - 5" and hose for the highrise packs are from 1.75" - 2.5" You will need to solve for the first scenario, and when you solve for the first section the next part of the scenario will populate.
       </p>
       <p><strong>You arrive on the scene to find an apartment building with smoke and flames coming from the <span class="scene-elevation"></span>. Your Officer tells you to go to the B side of the building and make a connection to the standpipe. The closest you can get to the standpipe is <span class="scene-FDC-size"></span> feet. You need to run <span class="scene-FDC-hose"></span> to the FDC to make the connection. You make the connection and start heading back to the pump panel. The firefighter is setting a up high rise pack that contains a <span class="scene-5"></span> foot <span class="scene-hose"></span> line from the truck<span class="scene-nozzle"></span>. The Firefighter and Officer start up the stairs to the floor below the fire. They radio in that they have made their connection and are about to start their attack. What psi will you run your connection at for this scenario?</strong></p>

       <p>You will notice that every time you refresh the page that the values change in the middle
        of the sentences. This is how the scenario will be dynamically populated</p>
